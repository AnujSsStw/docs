<p>Appwrite Storage allows you to manage files in your project. You can use it to store images, videos, documents, and other files for your projects. It provides APIs to upload, download, delete, and list files. Not only that Appwrite storage service provides APIs to manipulate images. Using the preview endpoint, you can crop, resize, rotate, add borders and border-radius and select the desired output format for your image. The preview API also allows you to change your image's quality, format, or compression, including WebP support for maximum optimization of your network bandwidth.

<h2><a href="/docs/storage#bucket" id="bucket">Buckets</a></h2>

<p>With version 0.13 of Appwrite, we also have introduced storage buckets. Storage buckets are similar to collections we have in our <a href="/docs/databases">Databases</a> service. The difference is buckets also provide more power to decide what kinds of files, what sizes you want to allow in that bucket, whether or not to encrypt the files, scan with antivirus, and more. Let's look at how we can create a bucket and configure it to your needs.</p>

<h3><a href="/docs/storage#createBucket" id="createBucket">Create Bucket</a></h3>

<p>You can create your bucket from your Appwrite project's dashboard, using any of our server-side SDKs, or directly using our REST API authenticated using an API Key. To create a bucket from the Appwrite Console, access your Storage dashboard from your project's left navigation panel. Click <b>Add Bucket</b> button and choose your bucket's name. You can also set a custom ID for your bucket instead of an auto-generated ID for convenience. This will create a new bucket and take you to its settings page, where you can configure various options for your bucket.</p>

<p>You can manage your buckets programmatically using one of Appwrite's Server <a href="/docs/sdks#server">SDKs</a> or REST API paired with an API Key. You can manage files with both Server and Client side.</p>

<h4><a href="/docs/storage#permission" id="permission">Permissions</a></h4>

<p>As buckets are very similar to collections we have in the database, we have a similar permission model. Buckets support either bucket level permission or file level permission to allow different ways to manage access to your buckets and files. Check out the <a href="/docs/permissions">Permissions</a>  documentation to learn more about the permissions types available.</p>

<h4>File-Level Permissions</h4>
<p>With this permission model, you have granular access control over every file, and users will only be able to access files for which they have explicit permissions. This permission model requires file permissions, and bucket permissions are optional.
</p>

<h4>Bucket-Level Permissions</h4>
<p>With bucket-level permissions, you assign permissions once for every file in the buckets' settings - users with "read" access to the bucket can see all files in that bucket. This permission model requires you to set bucket permissions on the bucket settings page. File permissions are optional and will not be evaluated even when set.</p>

<div class="notice margin-top-large margin-bottom-large">
    <h5>Active Session Required</h5>

    <p>For security purposes, an active Account session is required to create resources. So, even if wildcard write permissions are set, only logged-in users can create files in a bucket. If you require this behavior for your app, create an <a href="/docs/client/account?sdk=web-default#accountCreateAnonymousSession" target="_blank">anonymous session</a> first. An active session helps Appwrite enforce rate-control limits and protect your projects from intensive write operations.</p>
</div>

<h4><a href="/docs/storage#bucketConfig" id="bucketConfig">More Bucket Configurations</a></h4>

<p>Unlike collections, storage buckets have more configuration options regarding the type and size of the files in the bucket, encryption, and anti-virus scanning. If you look at the bucket settings or the REST API example above, you can find these configurations. Let's look at what those are:</p>

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" class="full margin-bottom-large">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th style="width: 250px">Parameter</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>allowedFileExtensions</td>
            <td>This parameter allows you to provide a list of file extensions that will be accepted into the bucket.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>maximumFileSize</td>
            <td>This parameter allows you to set the maximum size of a file that a bucket accepts. The buckets will accept any file less than or equal to the size provided here.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>encryption</td>
            <td>This parameter allows you to configure whether or not the files inside the bucket will be encrypted. We don't encrypt files bigger than 20MB.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>antivirus</td>
            <td>This parameter allows you to configure whether or not the files being added inside the bucket be scanned by antivirus. We don't scan files bigger than 20MB.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>You can learn more about storage buckets and APIs you can use to manage storage buckets from our <a href="docs/server/storage">Storage documentation</a>. Now that we know how to create and configure buckets for our applications, let's look at how to manage files using the storage service.</p>

<h2><a href="/docs/storage#createFile" id="createFile">Create File</a></h2>

<p>After you create a bucket or have navigated to bucket details, you can access the `Files` tab so you can upload, view, delete and update files in the bucket using the Appwrite project's dashboard. You can also perform all those operations from Appwrite's client SDK, server SDKs, and REST APIs as long as you have the proper permission.</p>

<p>When you are in the `Files` tab, you can click <b>Add File</b> and select a file to upload. If the bucket is configured to accept the file type and size you are uploading, your file will be uploaded, and you will see the file in the list of files.
</p>

<p>You can also upload files programmatically using our SDKs</p>

<p>When you are trying to upload any files above 5MB, you will need to upload them in chunks. Don't worry; if you are using Appwrite's console or any of our SDKs, we handle that internally, so it will work no matter what file size you try to upload.
</p>

<h2><a href="/docs/storage#imagePreview" id="imagePreview">Image Manipulation</a></h2>

<p>Another great built-in feature of Appwrite is the image manipulation feature. With Appwrite Storage's <a href="/docs/client/storage#storageGetFilePreview">preview endpoint</a> you can manipulate resolution, add borders and the border-radius, add background-color, set the opacity for the image, and get the image in the appropriate output format.
</p>

<p>This enables a wide range of possibilities! You can manipulate images resolution to display appropriately on responsive websites. You can also adjust the image border, background color, and border-radius to match the theming of your application. The Appwrite Storage also allows you to change the format and compression of your images for network transfer optimization and to help you speed your application. You can do all that without caring about how the image was originally uploaded.</p>

<p>Below you can find all the different parameters offered by the preview endpoint to manipulate the image.</p>

<h2><a href="/docs/storage#streaming" id="streaming">Downloading and Streaming with Range</a></h2>

<p>Apart from previewing files and images, downloading is another important feature. With 0.13 we also support streamed download using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Range" target="_blank">HTTP range header</a>. If you are using our SDKs or console, nothing is different. Even if you want to download the whole file at once, even if you use the REST endpoint directly, there isn't any difference. However, if you want to get only a part of a file from storage, you can supply the range header and the server will respond with an appropriate chunk of the file.</p>
